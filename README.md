# Labeled RISC-V based on Rocketchip

We build our labeled RISC-V prototype based on rocketchip.

# Quick Start Guide

>Ubuntu 16 recommend.（Don't use Ubunt 19.）

## Get source code

```bash
sudo apt install git vim
cd ~/Downloads
git clone https://github.com/LvNA-system/labeled-RISC-V.git
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Before Install
Ubuntu Packages needed
```bash
sudo apt-get install autoconf automake autotools-dev curl libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev libgmp-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev gawk build-essential bison flex texinfo gperf libtool patchutils bc zlib1g-dev device-tree-compiler pkg-config libexpat-dev
```

java needed
```bash
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
```

## Get Tool-Chains
If you are using ICT' network such as ICT_Guest or ICT_WLAN, you can download tool-chains from [http://10.30.6.127:8000/riscv-toolchain-2018.05.24.tar.gz](http://10.30.6.127:8000/riscv-toolchain-2018.05.24.tar.gz)

Extract the `tar.gz` to `~/Downloads`

Now your `~/Downloads` Directory looks like this:
```
.
├── labeld-RISC-V             
└── riscv-toolchain-2018.05.24         
```

## Set Envelopment Variables - PATH
check the full path
```bash
cd ~/Downloads
echo $(pwd)
#/home/xxx/Dowloads
```
you will get a string like this `/home/YOURNAME/Downloads`.
**When using this path, Remember change the `YOURNAME` with your real path from the terminal.**

```bash
sudo vim /etc/profile
```
press <kbd>G</kbd> to move to last line. press <kbd>i</kbd> to input words. Then type the code into the panel.
```
export RISCV=/home/YOURNAME/Downloads/riscv-toolchain-2018.05.24
export PATH=$PATH:$RISCV/bin
export RISCV_ROOTFS_HOME=/home/YOURNAME/Downloads/sw
```
Then push `ESC` and input `wq!` to save this file.

Make it come into effect.
```bash
source /etc/profile
```
## Build
```bash
cd ~/Downloads/labeld-RISC-V/fpga
mkdir build
make -j16 sw  # change 16 to the number of cores according to your host
```

After that, `linux.bin` will be generated under `build/`.
This is a minimal rootfs only containing a `hello` program.

## Run with emulator

```
cd /home/YOURNAME/Downloads/labeled-RISC-V/bootrom 
make
cd ../fpga/emu
make -j16 emu 
make -j16 run-emu
```
The following files will be generated
1. `build/generated-src/` is the directory containing files generated by origin rocketchip project
2. `build/emu.log` is the output of emulator, including `printf()` and `assert()` in scala code
3. `build/serial@6000?000` is the output of the ?th UART. Use `tail -f serial@60000000` to observe the output.

It may cost about one hour (it depends on the performance of your host) to boot linux in emulator.

## Run with FPGA

### Build a Vivado project

* Install Vivado 2017.4, and source the setting of Vivado and SDK
* Run the following command to build a Vivado project
```
make project PRJ=myproject BOARD=zcu102
```
Change `zcu102` to the target board you want. Supported boards are listed under `board/`.
The project will be created under `board/zcu102/build/myproject-zedzcu102`.
* Open the project with Vivado and generate bitstream.

### Prepare SD card

Refer to the instructions of [boot/README.md](boot/README.md).

NOTE: Remember to put the bitstream into BOOT.BIN, since the guide is going to boot everything from SD card.

### Set your board to SD boot mode

Please refer to the user guide of your board.
* [zedboard](http://www.zedboard.org/sites/default/files/ZedBoard_HW_UG_v1_1.pdf)
* [zcu102](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/boards_and_kits/zcu102/ug1182-zcu102-eval-bd.pdf)
* [sidewinder](http://sidewinder.fidus.com)
* ultraZ (currently not avaliable to the public)

### Boot linux in PRM

NOTE: PRM is short for Platform Resource Manager, which is acted by PS part of the board.

To boot linux in PRM, just insert the SD card into the board, open a serial terminal and powerup the board.

### Boot RISC-V subsystem

Due to different resources in different FPGA devices,
the configures of RISC-V subsystem are different among boards.

| Board | # RISC-V cores | Frequency | # BTB entries | L2 cache size | Memory size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| zedboard | 2 | 50 MHz | 0 | 256 KB | 128 MB |
| zcu102 | 4 | 100 MHz | 40 | 2 MB | 2 GB |
| sidewinder | 4 | 100 MHz | 40 | 2 MB | 2 GB |
| ultraZ | 2 | 100 MHz | 0 | 256 KB | 1 GB |

For details, please read [LvNAConfigs.scala](../src/main/scala/lvna/LvNAConfigs.scala).

To boot the RISC-V subsystem
* Clone the [prm-sw repo](https://github.com/LvNA-system/prm-sw).
`prm-sw` contains tools to boot and control the RISC-V subsystem.
For details, please refer to the README.md under the `prm-sw` directory.
* Send the `prm-sw` directory to PRM.
This can be achieved by either copying the file to SD card,
or by sending the file with `scp` if you have your board connected to your host by network.
* Compile the tools on PRM.
```
cd path-to-prm-sw/apps/axi-loader && make PLATFORM=fpga [BOARD=zynq]
cd path-to-prm-sw/apps/pardctl && make PLATFORM=fpga [BOARD=zynq]
cd path-to-prm-sw/apps/stab && make PLATFORM=fpga [BOARD=zynq]
```
If the target board is zynq, add the `BOARD=zynq` argument specified above.

#### Build RISC-V image for FPGA

```
cd path-to-labeled-RISC-V/../sw/riscv-linux
make ARCH=riscv CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu- fpga_defconfig
cd path-to-labeled-RISC-V/fpga
make -j16 sw
```

This will generator `linux.bin` under `build/`.
This is a rootfs containing busybox to use in FPGA.
Then put `linux.bin` under `path-to-prm-sw/apps/axi-loader/` on PRM.

#### SMP Boot

SMP boot allows running one OS on multiple cores.
This is the traditional way to use a multi-core system.

* Open minicom on PRM to connect to the UART of RISC-V subsystem.
Note that you can connect to PRM via `ssh` and use `tmux` to get multiple terminals.
```
minicom -D /dev/ttyUL1
```
* Run the script to boot RISC-V subsystem in SMP mode.
```
cd path-to-prm-sw/apps/axi-loader
bash runme-smp.sh [board]
bash hard-reset.sh  # this is a temporary fix to the reset system
```
It may cost about 50s for zedboard to boot the RISC-V subsystem. Most of the time is spent in unpacking ramdisk image.

NOTE: Currently the process-level label machenism in the SMP OS does not work well.
To use label, please use NoHype mode below.

#### NoHype Boot

Currently we are working on this part.

<!--
NoHype boot allows running multiple OSes on multiple cores.
This is a new virtualization method provided by LvNA.

* Open 4 minicoms in different terminals on PRM to connect to the UARTs of RISC-V subsystem.
Note that you can connect to PRM via `ssh` and use `tmux` to get multiple terminals.
```
minicom -D /dev/ttyUL1
minicom -D /dev/ttyUL2
minicom -D /dev/ttyUL3
minicom -D /dev/ttyUL4
```
* Run the script to boot every cores of the RISC-V subsystem in NoHype mode.
```
cd path-to-prm-sw/app/axi-loader
bash hard-reset.sh
bash runme-nohype.sh [board] 0
bash runme-nohype.sh [board] 1
...
```
NOTE: Do not call `runme-nohype.sh` with a `hartid` larger than the number of RISC-V cores on the board.
Else the behavior is undefined.

#### Label-Based Performance Counters

Open a new terminal on PRM. Then run
```
cd path-to-prm-sw/app/stab/build
./stab-fpga [board]
```
This will show all statistic counters every second.

#### Label-Based Performance Control

Open a new terminal on PRM. Then run
```
cd path-to-prm-sw/app/pardctl
ls cp-config/?core/

# pick one of the configure file
./build/pardctl-fpga < cp-config/2core/LLC-12-4-config
```

Currently we provide the configure files to adjust the LLC way partition
and the memory bandwidth allocation before LLC.
For details, please refer to the [README.md about pardctl](prm-sw/app/pardctl/README.md).
